//Adherence_ refers to what percentage of `Meal`s are "complete"'
// i.e., what percentage of meals contain Fruits; Vegetables; Protein; _and_ Fat.
// `isOntrack` method determines whether this `User`'s adherence is above their "threshold."

//The `viewMeals` method should print the name of each meal in the MealTracker.
